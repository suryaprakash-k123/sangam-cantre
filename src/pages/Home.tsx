                In the rapidly evolving landscape of India's cultural and
                policy-making environment, the need for specialized think tank
                that bridges the gap between cultural heritage and contemporary
                governance has never been more critical.

                The Sangam Centre for Culture and Public Policy—a space where
                the richness of Indian traditions meets the dynamism of
                contemporary policies. At Sangam, we believe that cultural

              <p className="newspaper-body text-lg text-navy-800 leading-relaxed">
                The think tank sector in India has experienced significant
                growth, with the country now hosting 509 think tanks as of 2018,
                making it the second-largest concentration globally after the
                United States. This proliferation reflects India's growing
                intellectual capacity and the increasing complexity of policy
                challenges facing the nation. Within this context, cultural
                policy research remains an underexplored yet crucial domain that
                requires dedicated institutional focus. The intersection of
                culture and public policy in India presents unique opportunities
                and challenges. On one hand, India's diverse cultural heritage
                provides immense soft power potential, with initiatives and
                various schemes promoting traditional arts, digital preservation
                programs, and cultural diplomacy efforts. On the other hand,
                policy frameworks often struggle to adequately address the
                nuanced needs of cultural preservation, promotion, and
                integration with contemporary development goals.
