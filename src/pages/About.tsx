                The philosophy of the Sangam Centre for Culture and Public
                Policy should be anchored in the profound meaning of "Sangam" -
                confluence - which represents the sacred meeting point where
                diverse streams unite to create something greater than their
                individual parts. Drawing from the rich tradition of the ancient
                Tamil Sangams, which were assemblies of learned people dedicated
                to the flourishing of literature, culture, and wisdom, the
                centre's philosophy should embrace the concept of intellectual
                and cultural confluence as its foundational principle.

                Established in 2018, Delhi Chapter | Sangam Centre emerged from
                the recognition that India's complex policy challenges require
                nuanced, evidence-based solutions. Founded by a group of
                distinguished academics and policy practitioners, our
                organization has grown to become a respected voice in India's
                policy discourse.

                multiple domains, from economic reforms and social development
                to digital governance and environmental sustainability. Our
                research has informed parliamentary discussions, influenced
                government policies, and contributed to academic literature.
